# ffxivmb_act_plugin
ACT Plugin for sharing marketboard data to FFXIVMB.

Had been planning to do this for a long time but never got around to it. Glad that a very cool dude called goaaats decided to code
an open source marketboard parser since a lot of people prefer the openness and I am too ashamed to release my ugly code.
As I study it more over the coming weekends I might add the inventory, desynth and other functions that my closed source marketsense
parser does.

If you need any help getting this project to run msg me @purveyor in https://discord.gg/8XBMC9v
